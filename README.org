Been telling myself, all I need is 20 seconds of insane courage and something amazing will happen.

- All I need is 20 seconds of insane courage, to put on my running shoes.
- All I need is 20 seconds of insane courage, to make that phone call to potential customers.
- All I need is 20 seconds of insane courage, to ask for a date.

20 seconds, never been easier for me.
